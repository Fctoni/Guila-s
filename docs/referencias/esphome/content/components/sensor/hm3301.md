The `HM3301` sensor platform allows you to use your HM3301 particulate matter sensor
([more info](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Laser_PM2.5_Sensor-HM3301))
sensors with ESPHome.

The sensor communicate with board by [I²C](/components/i2c) protocol, and requires 3.3v.

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
i2c:

sensor:
  - platform: hm3301
    pm_1_0:
      name: "PM1.0"
    pm_2_5:
      name: "PM2.5"
    pm_10_0:
      name: "PM10.0"
    aqi:
      name: "AQI"
      calculation_type: "CAQI"
```

## Configuration variables

- **pm_1_0** (*Optional*): Use the concentration of particulates of size less than 1.0µm in µg per cubic meter.

  - All options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

- **pm_2_5** (*Optional*): Use the concentration of particulates of size less than 2.5µm in µg per cubic meter.

  - All options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

- **pm_10_0** (*Optional*): Use the concentration of particulates of size less than 10.0µm in µg per cubic meter.

  - All options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

  - **calculation_type** (**Required**): One of: `AQI` or `CAQI`.
  - All other options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

## Air Quality Index

The AQI (Air Quality Index) sensor calculates an air quality index value based on the
PM2.5 and PM10 particulate matter concentrations. This provides a single number that
indicates overall air quality and associated health concerns.

Two calculation standards are supported:

- **AQI** (US EPA Air Quality Index): The standard used in the United States, Canada,
  and parts of Asia. Scale of 0-500+.
- **CAQI** (Common Air Quality Index): The European standard. Scale of 0-400.

Both calculation types take the PM2.5 and PM10 values and return the higher
(more conservative) of the two calculated index values.

### AQI Scale (US EPA)

| Index | Level | Health Implications |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| 0-50 | Good | Air quality is satisfactory |
| 51-100 | Moderate | Some pollutants may be a concern for sensitive individuals |
| 101-150 | Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups | Sensitive groups may experience health effects |
| 151-200 | Unhealthy | Everyone may begin to experience health effects |
| 201-300 | Very Unhealthy | Everyone may experience more serious health effects |
| 301-500 | Hazardous | Health warnings of emergency conditions |

### CAQI Scale (European)

| Index | Level | Health Implications |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| 0-25 | Very Low | Air quality is excellent |
| 26-50 | Low | Air quality is good |
| 51-75 | Medium | Air quality is fair |
| 76-100 | High | Air quality is poor |
| 101-400 | Very High | Air quality is very poor |

### Configuration Example

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: hm3301
    pm_2_5:
      name: "PM2.5"
    pm_10_0:
      name: "PM10.0"
    aqi:
      name: "Air Quality Index"
      calculation_type: "CAQI"  # or "AQI" for US EPA standard
      # Optional: Apply filters for smoother values
      filters:
        - sliding_window_moving_average:
            window_size: 10
            send_every: 1
```
